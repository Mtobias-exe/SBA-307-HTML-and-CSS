# SBA 307: HTML and CSS
This was my first time creating a website using HTML and CSS and it was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I learned many lessons along the way and I am looking forward to learn more to improve my skills in the future.

# Technical Specification and Website Description
The website consist of following four pages:
    - Landing page: Includes a brief introduction and an interactive quote section. Below, you can find a showcase of my graphic designs and a contact form that is currently under development.
    - About Me: Summary of my background and my interests.
    - Contact Page: Links you to my LinkedIn account, as well as fun survey form at the bottom
    - Skills: Accessible via drop-down menu that looks a little weird but it works
